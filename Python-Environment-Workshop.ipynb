    "This notebook will help you setup the initial python environment. While there are many ways and resources to get started with, there usually comes a point when these techniques fail if you don't have the right set of tools to begin with. To help you better understand, imagine you want to grow a tree in your backyard. Well, you have this tree sapling along with sickle to plough the soil and the watering can. Don't you think we are missing something..? What about the type of soil required for growing it, or the enivronment? We need the right fertilizers or pesticides to keep it safe from bugs. Likewise, when it comes to programming in general, we need to make sure we have the right set of environment along with the relevant libraries to make the entire system to function efficiently. \n",

    "\n",
    "By default we are on master. Its a good practice to have seperate branch for development and other feature development.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new branch from master, do:\n",
    "```git\n",
    "git checkout -b *branch_name*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Branch Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have finished working on your code, you need to incorporate those changes on the branch common to all users, in our case it can be either **sandbox** for testing or the **develop** for final pushes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For branch merging, always remember the following rules - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Commit and push the changes on your branch as described in Part 1\n",
    "2. Pull the latest changes from the develop branch (assuming you will be merging your branch to develop) using following command: \n",
    "```git\n",
    "git pull origin develop\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Push those new changes to your branch having resolved the conflicts\n",
    "4. Checkout to the develop branch using: \n",
    "```git\n",
    "git checkout develop\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Pull your branch to merge into develop.the below code will merge your branch into develop: \n",
    "```git\n",
    "git pull origin *your_branch*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally push the updated develop using : \n",
    "```git \n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternate Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, when you have commited the changes and pushed it on your branch, you can checkout to the branch where you want to merge your current branch. Say you want to merge your current branch **sandbox** to **develop**. So having commited changes to sandbox, you can checkout to develop and then do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```git\n",
    "git merge sandbox\n",
    "```\n",
    "And then push it using git push.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, always follow the above procedure for merging into any branch. The develop can be replaced by any branch into which you would like to merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about [Merging](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4: Stashing \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say there is an important piece of code which needs to be incorporated into your branch and you still haven't finished your work, or your friend is stuck somewhere and you need to go to his branch to solve the issue and here too, your work is not finished, in such cases, you cannot push your incomplete code. Stashing helps you save the current state of your code in memory so that when you come back to your branch of have incorporated some external changes, you can retrieve the saved changes back into your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To stash use: \n",
    "```git\n",
    "git stash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you return to your branch again or have completed incorporating external changes do: \n",
    "```git\n",
    "git stash pop \n",
    "```\n",
    "This will reapply the stashed changes to your code and remove it from the memory stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more about [Stashing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 5: Resolving Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Every now and then, there might arise situations and cases where you have to resolve merge conflicts. Merge conflicts arise when 2 version of the same part of the code exist and git does not know what to do. It either resolves most of them automatically, but in some places it asks for user intervention for resolving the conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflicts look somewhat like this\n",
    "```\n",
    "<<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "print(a + b)\n",
    "=======\n",
    "print(a * b).\n",
    ">>>>>>> branch-name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In such case, git does not know if you want code **print(a + b)** or **print(a * b)** to be kept. So the part above ==== is something which is there on the local currently, while the part below ==== is something which came from the remote location to your branch either due to merge or pull. You should keep either one of the code and remove *<<<<< HEAD*, *=====* and *>>>>>> branch-name* lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, commit your changes and push it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on [Conflict Resolution](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 6: Branch Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "Often at times when you have to get some bugs fixed or feature incorporated, you may create a seperate branch for development. At times, too many branches can make your development lifecycle quite congested; so a good practice is to delete unwanted or dormant branches. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting a branch is a 2 way process since you need to remove both the local as well as the remote branches. \n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a local branch you should **NOT BE ON THAT BRANCH**. Well, this is quite obvious since you can't remove a branch, while you are on it. So as a first step, checkout to master branch using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```git\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to delete a local branch, say sandbox, run\n",
    "\n",
    "```git\n",
    "git branch -d sandbox\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above line removes your branch locally, but it still exists on remote, so to delete it completely, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```git \n",
    "git push origin --delete sandbox\n",
    "```\n",
    "For more on [Branch Deletion](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 7: Configuring .gitignore file\n",
    "\n",
    "You certainly don't want to push all the files to github. Many a times you have data files, or .ipynb_checkpoints which needs to be ignored to be pushed to github. So basically .gitignore files are not tracked by git and they remain on your local machine itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "If .gitignore file does not exist, create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then place the files which you want to ignore. Say you want to ignore, .ipynb_checkpoints everywhere in your directory, then you place a line in .gitignore as:\n",
    "\n",
    "*.ipynb_checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps you ignore all the files where the extension is .ipynb_checkpoints and it is not tracked by git at all. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Part 8: Configuring README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "Readme is a file which explains your project. It has information on project description, installation steps, libraries used, citations, authors... etc. Readme is written in Markdown language. If you don't want to get into the nuts and bolts of HTML and CSS, then Markdown helps you create web elements. A better way to visualize it is, it acts like a wrapper.\n",
